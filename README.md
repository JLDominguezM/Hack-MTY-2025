# SmartBan

## Elevator Pitch

SmartBan is an innovative feature integrated into the Banorte app, designed as a comprehensive solution for smart cities. Its goal is to centralize and streamline citizen procedures and payments, transforming the user experience.

The platform enables payment of essential services such as electricity and gas, as well as municipal taxes (property tax, fines, verifications). It also introduces a unique system for sending and receiving tips via QR codes, facilitating fast and secure peer-to-peer transactions.

SmartBan optimizes time, reducing procedures from 20–40 minutes to just 2–5, representing a 90% gain in efficiency. The business model is based on commissions for municipal payments (1%) and tips (0.5%), offering an estimated ROI of 61% in the first year.

More than just an idea, SmartBan is a strategy that positions Banorte not only as a bank, but as an essential connector for digital citizenship.

## Why React Native & Expo?

React Native allows us to write truly native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, sharing most of the codebase between platforms. Expo accelerates development with powerful tools, easy device testing, and over-the-air updates, so we can focus on building features instead of wrestling with native build tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

Start developing by editing files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for easy navigation.
